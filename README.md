# Uni Course Codes
This folder contains the code used throughout university for assignments, reports, practice and in general fun.
A brief description for the work done during each course is shown bellow.

## Course Description
- **Analogue Mixed Signal 3**: This course required developing a TIA based optical audio amplifier. The code is used to represent frequency response, noise SNR and other data using python `matplotlib`.
- **Control and Instrumentation Engineering 3**: This course aims analyses the difference between real-life and mathematical models of systems and how to use both to predict a accurate transfer functions of systems. The final task required controlling the position in radians of a spin table top. Most code is used to read CSV files and diplay plots.
- **Digital Systems Lab 3**: This course familiarises us with Verilog and basic test bench setup for FPGA's. The course leads us from designing a shift register to building state machines and finally a snake game connecting the FPGA with display via VGA port.
- **Electromagnetism 3**: This course required completing an assignment, which analysed data from a VNA connected to a microstrip. The standing wave ratio (SWR) was the important feature analysed. Data from CSV files were read and displayed as plots.
- **Engineering Software 3**: This course uses the microblaze processor within a FPGA to control multiple interfaces of and connected to a FPGA. The final assignment required designing an obstacle avoiding course. The user controled its player with switches on the FPGA.
- **Signal Communication 3**: This course introduced MATLAB and analysing basics of signal processing. A course assignmnet required to perform MPEG compression on monochromatic and coloured images using cosine transforms.
