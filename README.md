# Uni Course Codes
This folder contains the code used throughout university for assignments, reports, practice and in general fun.
A brief description for the work done during each course is shown bellow.

## Course Description
- **Analogue Mixed Signal 3**: This course required developing a TIA based optical audio amplifier. The code is used to represent frequency response, noise SNR and other data using python `matplotlib`.
- **Control and Instrumentation Engineering 3**: This course aims to analyse the difference between the real-life response vs the mathematical models for a system. This allowed to predict accurate transfer functions for the system. The final task required controlling the position of a spinable table top. Most code here is used to read CSV files and diplay python plots.
- **Digital Systems Lab 3**: This course familiarises us with Verilog and basic test bench setup for FPGA's. The course leads us from designing a shift register to building state machines. The last exercise is to design a snake game connecting the FPGA via a VGA port to a display.
- **Electromagnetism 3**: This course required completing an assignment, which analysed data from a VNA connected to a microstrip. The standing wave ratio (SWR) was the important feature analysed. Data from CSV files were read and displayed as python plots.
- **Engineering Software 3**: This course uses the microblaze processor of the Xillinx FPGA to control multiple interfaces of and connected to thr FPGA. The final assignment required designing an obstacle avoiding game. The user controled its player with switches on the FPGA.
- **Signal Communication 3**: This course introduced MATLAB and analysing basics of signal processing. The course assignmnet required to write MPEG compression for monochromatic and coloured images, which used cosine transforms.
